WP Workbench is a new Virtualmin plugin designed to simplify WordPress site management. It provides a clear, centralized interface for handling plugins, themes, backups, cloning, and development settings—all in one place for a WordPress instance. Whether you prefer a graphical interface or CLI, WP Workbench gives you direct access to essential WordPress management tools without needing WordPress admin credentials.

## Installation

WP Workbench is available in standard Virtualmin repositories and can be easily
installed using your system's package manager:

**For Debian and derivatives:**
```
apt install virtualmin-wp-workbench
```

**For EL systems:**
```
dnf install virtualmin-wp-workbench
```

After installation, the module will appear on the "Manage Web Apps" page when a
specific WordPress instance is selected.

## Why Use WP Workbench?

- **Simplified management**: Control your WordPress sites directly from Virtualmin
- **Time-saving**: Perform bulk operations on plugins and themes
- **Enhanced security**: Backup and restore options provide peace of mind
- **Developer-friendly**: Access to cloning, debugging, and maintenance tools
- **Convenience**: One-click WordPress admin access
- **Automation**: Robust CLI for scripting common tasks with full integration with Virtualmin

## User Interface

### System Tab

This tab helps you optimize WordPress performance and security:

- **Memory limit**: Set how much memory each script can use (default: 40M)
  
  For small to medium sites, the default might be enough. Increase this if you have many plugins or complex functionality.

- **Admin memory limit**: Allocate more memory for admin tasks (default: 256M)
  
  This higher limit ensures plugin installations, updates, and admin tasks run smoothly.

- **Fail2Ban protection integration**: Guard against brute force attacks
  
  Monitors failed login attempts and temporarily blocks suspicious IP addresses.

- **WordPress auto-updates**: Control update behavior
  
  Choose between disabling all auto-updates, allowing only minor updates, or enabling all updates.
