Virtualmin is a powerful and flexible web hosting control panel for Linux, built for web developers, IT professionals, agencies, and hosting providers. It can run on almost any Linux distribution, with a hassle-free automated installer available for Debian and Ubuntu, AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It is available as a community-supported open-source GPL edition and a feature-packed Pro version. It brings together DNS, SSL, web, mail, and backups in one place, with local and cloud DNS, automatic SSL, Apache or Nginx with multiple PHP versions, a full mail stack with spam and virus protection, and scheduled backups to popular cloud storage services. WP Workbench adds one central place to manage WordPress core, plugins, themes, backups, cloning, and quick admin access, while the built-in CLI and remote HTTP API make it easy to automate server setup, everyday tasks, and bulk changes across all your sites and services.
